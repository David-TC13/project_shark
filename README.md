# 1. Project_shark_attacks:

In this case we gonna analyse three hypothesis about the shark attacks happend:

##  Shark attacks more likely to happen in summer than in other seasons?
Due to the mass tourism since 1950, we want to analyse if there's a cause consequence in between this phenomenons; it means, if the shark attacks are happening more in summer as consequence of the increasing amount of people during this season in the sea. 

With this objetive we will need to clear the data according to the context we want to use it. 
After it, we will need to set the summer season: because the summer in the North is in different dates than the South, needs to set up the summer on each country happened the incident and determine if it was in summer or not.

## Even there've been happening attacks the fatalities of those are insignificant comparing the amount happen
## Which activities are more prone to cause an attack.
